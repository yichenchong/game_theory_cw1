# Equilibria at $R = 12$

This directory contains the equilibria for $2 < N < 12$ and $R = 12$. Each file, named '<N>.csv' contains the equilibria for a given $N$, where each row denotes a different equilibrium in $L$ notation.

These were generated using the code in `generate_equilibria.py`, where the output was saved to a file rather than printed.
